This is a dashboard that can directly compare the annual gross State Products in the US with the gross domestic products from countries around the world.
You can click within either map you'd like, the left representing the world countries, and the right representing the US states, and compare their respective GDPS  GSPs in the line chart from the year 1997
GSP info only goes back to 1997, so this is why this time window through the present was used.
